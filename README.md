Pokemon Team Planner

Welcome to the Pokemon Team Planner! This application aims to assist players in planning their team composition and managing their resources effectively. 
Designed with the intention of providing a structured approach to Pokemon training, this app will help you stay focused on your goals and make informed decisions throughout your journey.

Purpose:
Many players that played Pokemon games like ultra sun & moon, including myself and my wife, have experienced the overwhelming task of choosing which Pokemon to focus on and invest their time and resources in. 
It's common to encounter new Pokemon or catch different species that tempt us to change our plans constantly. 
This app addresses these challenges by providing a comprehensive planning tool, allowing players to strategize and stay committed to their goals.
